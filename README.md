JS13KGames entry for 2022, theme is "**DEATH**".

## Bee Kind
*WIP - You play as a rabbit trying to save the bees, there are alien grubs which turn into flying killers when they eat toadstools. The bees go between flowers and their hives but the killers try to stop them. If the bees die out, we all die, so it's a crucial mission. You get a gun which shoots honey and neutralises the enemies. Once the bees have made enough honey in their hives you can progress to the next level*
